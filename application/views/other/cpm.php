          <p><span><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i>  Contractors Plant and Machinery Insurance or CPM insurance is an all-risk insurance policy that  provides coverage for the plant and machinery of a contractor for a specific worksite. Machinery and plants  such as forklift trucks, bulldozers, compressors, drilling machines, etc. are most of the time used in rough conditions and hence they are more vulnerable to damage. Breakdown of these machineries can pause the completion of the on-going project and hence may put other things at risk. In such a situation, the CPM policy  comes as a rescue. Under this policy, the contracts get coverage against any unforeseen and sudden physical damage or loss to his/her plant and machinery.</p>
