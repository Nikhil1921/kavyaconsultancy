            <p><span><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i>  Many people are not sure whether they need a shopkeepers insurance policy to protect their shop or not. To give you some clarity, here is a list of different kinds of people who must buy shop insurance plans:</span></p>
            <h6 class="per_acc_h6 h6_per_acc">Independent Shopkeepers</h6>
            <p><span><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i>  People who run a shop as their primary source of income should get it insured under the shop insurance plans. This is because any unforeseen loss or damage to the shop will directly affect their livelihood and thus, they need to stay prepared for any adverse circumstances.</span></p>
            <h6 class="per_acc_h6 h6_per_acc">Family Business Owners</h6>
            <p><span><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i>  If you run or operate a shop, which is owned by you or your family, and sell products such as clothes, footwear, furniture, stationery, etc. should get themselves as a shopkeepers insurance policy.</span></p>
            <h6 class="per_acc_h6 h6_per_acc">Shopkeepers with Shops in Prime Areas</h6>
            <p><span><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i>  In case you own a shop at one of the prime locations or markets in the city, then you should definitely need insurance to protect your shop. This is important because prime locations are more prone to risks than other areas.</span></p>
            <h6 class="per_acc_h6 h6_per_acc">High-Risk Businesses</h6>
            <p><span><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i>  Certain kinds of shops or businesses are more prone to risks or dangers. For example, a CNG fuel station is more susceptible to fire than a stationery shop. Similarly, an electronic shop is more likely to get robbed than a footwear shop. Therefore, it is important for people running high-risk businesses to own a shopkeeper insurance plan to stay covered against any eventuality.</span></p>
            <h6 class="per_acc_h6 h6_per_acc">Multiple Shop Owners</h6>
            <p><span><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i>  Shop insurance plans are not only meant for people who own one shop but also for people who own multiple shops. The probability of facing an emergency increases with more number of shops. Thus, multiple shop owners should make sure to buy a policy for each of their shops.</span></p>
