            <li>First things first, house insurance is important as it protects your dwelling from any damage/loss that may incur at any point in time. For instance, if a tree fell upon the roof of your house or a vehicle collided with the boundary wall of your home premises, the right type of property insurance will cover for the incurred expenses.</li>
            <li>On the off chance, if you intend to take a loan to either construct a house or buy a hose the bank will ask you to provide evidence that the property is insured on, which you are looking forward to taking a loan.</li>
            <li>In case, if a third-person suffers any kind of injury while on your property, having a home insurance policy will secure you from any legal and third-party liabilities.</li>
            <li>In case of damage occurs to the insured property, having the right property insurance will provide cover for the repairment expenses.</li>
            <li>It also provides cover for the appliances such as air conditioner, refrigerator, television, microwaves and other electrical appliances, furniture and furnishings and at times the jewellery as well depending on the type of house insurance plan you choose.</li>
            <li>Choosing the right property insurance provides coverage even if you are not present at your home and you are at a distant place. Besides, in the process of repairment/reconstruction, alternate accommodation for a specified time will also be arranged. A home insurance policy will cover all the incurred expenses.</li>
            <li>The home insurance policy also provides cover for any damage/loss incurred either due to theft or due to robbery.</li>
