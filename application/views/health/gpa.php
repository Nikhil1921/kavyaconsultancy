            <p><span><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i>  Accidents not only create physical disablement (permanent or temporary) but can also come with the financial crisis for both the sufferer and his/her family. Since we all are exposed to accidents in our day to day life, and if the accident occurs with the breadwinner of the family, then the situations can be troublesome. Therefore, in the modern era where organizations are becoming more and more customer-centric, it has become important to opt for an insurance policy that provides compensation in case of an accident that has caused disablement or death.</span></p>
            <p><span><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i>  In order to cater to such needs of the organizations, group accidental insurance policies are introduced. These policies offer comprehensive coverage to the group of people against accidental disability and death.</span></p>
