            <p><span><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i>  Coronavirus Health Insurance refers to an insurance policy that covers the medical expenses incurred on the treatment of COVID-19. A coronavirus health insurance policy is designed to cover the hospitalization expenses of the policyholder, irrespective of the disease that he has been diagnosed with (unless it is a critical illness that is not covered). Almost all the health insurance plans cover hospitalization expenses incurred on the treatment of viral infections. Since Coronavirus is a viral infection, a comprehensive health insurance policy pays off pre & post hospitalization expenses including in-patient and out-patient expenses, incurred on the treatment of COVID-19 and its variants, including omicron.</p>
            <p><span><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i>  Health insurance for coronavirus cover will be available from the day the insured gets diagnosed with the disease. This is because COVID-19 is a new disease and therefore, does not come under the category of pre-existing illness.</p>
